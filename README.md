# Python.n1
Study and notes

At this stage of learning I intend to comit my notes to get used to working with git on a daily basis I have not done this before when learning Java, C#.

This will be my first try of commit at Python.n1 file

Variables:
  - snake_case (user_iq = 190; don't make double " _ " -bad practice)
  - Start with lowercase or underscore 
  - Letters, numbers, underscores
  - Case sensitive
  - Don't overwrite keywords. (print = 190   ->   print(print) - WRONG)
